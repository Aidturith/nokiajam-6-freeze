- 1 skill point for each figure
- 20 stamina point depleted for each figure (skating stops at 0 stamina)
- 30 stamina point depleted for each mistake

Determine available figures.

- Make the pinguin age 1 day.
- Refil the stamina gauge.
- Learn new skill if enough skill points.

## Second row of icons

It does:
- add 1 happy heart

A hidden stat would be the mistake counter.

## Game over cases

- age over 30 and anything reaches 0
- mistakes over 5 and anything reaches 0

Count as a mistake after not reacting to a warning for 10 seconds :
- not healing an injury
- not cleaning
- starving
- unhappy

## Growth system

Stages :
- 2 day egg
- 2 day baby
- 3 day child
- 5 day teen
- 20 day adult

## Skill system

Earning skill points through figures.

A day should not go further than 5 minutes. So with 100 stamina, player looses 1 stamina every 3 seconds, doing a figure deplets 20 stamina (1 minute).

4 good figures per day, over 25 days is 100 skill points.

(Spins, jumps, Harness)
- 0 points, jump
- 0 points, spin
- 5 points, bum spin


## Medal system

## Predator system

A bear appears sometimes (5% chance) , you have to run on the other side or become injured (Shader for fading out trash an other things).

## Skating system

Jump scoring is distance, speed, height, rotation.
Same jump = 80% scoring.
Edge should be taken into consideration.

Hmm, the officials figures looks very boring and too technical for a tamagochi game. I need something simpler and more flashy.

The spins look's like fun:
- Spin + down = bum spin
- Spin + down down = belly spin (you're a pinguin)
- Spin + down down down = head spin (street dance ?)
- Spin + side = T/camel spin
- Spin + up = ballerine/upright

Belly slide for speed boost.

Jumps :
- Back flip
- Arctic sunshine
- Primal hoot
- Drill on ice and chain an other jump
